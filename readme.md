This is a basic multiplayer game made with a Deno backend and a p5js frontend, the two communicate via websockets. Keep in mind, unlike my [Auto Lip Sync](https://github.com/AI-Spawn/Auto-Lip-Sync) tool, the primary goal of this project was to learn new technologies, and not to make a maintainable codebase that can be continuously improved and given new features. That said, feel free to use this code as you like, and if you just want to host your own private version of this game, either use the deploy to heroku button or (for advanced users) `deno run --unstable --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env src/server.ts`
